            <div>WHAT ARE SOME COMMON RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES USED BY INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS IN THE STOCK MARKET?</div>
            <p>institutional investors employ various risk management techniques to mitigate potential losses and protect their portfolios. Some common techniques include:

            Diversification: Spreading investments across different asset classes, sectors, regions, and investment styles to reduce exposure to any single risk factor.
            Portfolio Optimization: Using mathematical models to allocate assets in a way that maximizes returns for a given level of risk or minimizes risk for a given level of return.
            Value at Risk (VaR) Analysis: Quantifying the maximum potential loss of a portfolio over a specific time horizon at a given confidence level.
            Stress Testing: Assessing the impact of adverse market scenarios or extreme events on a portfolio's performance.
            Risk Monitoring and Reporting: Implementing systems to monitor portfolio risk metrics in real-time and generate reports for stakeholders.
            These techniques help institutional investors manage risk and achieve their investment objectives in the dynamic and often unpredictable stock marketÂ environment.</p>
